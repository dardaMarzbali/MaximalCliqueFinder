# Maximal Clique Finder
In this term project, we made a project that it calculates the maximal clique in Hamming graphs. Hamming graph is special graph that used in mathematics and computer science. Also Hamming graph is represent as a H(n, d). In computer science, hamming graph is a graph that the vertices represent all possible binary string of a certain length. This length will equal with the n value from H(n, d). Moreover, in hamming graph vertices can be known as the 2n value. Moreover, d represents the minimum distance for two vertices.
 - On the other hand, for calculate the maximal clique in hamming graph, also we need to know the hamming distance. Hamming distance is very popular theory for computer science. In computer science, the hamming distance comparing two binary strings also in some sources, they compare two string value. While comparing two binary strings of equal length, hamming distance is the number of different bit positions.
 - While we create our hamming graph based on n and d values, also we need to know the edges between the vertices. With hamming distance theory we can calculate the edges with minimum distance(d) and we can know that which vertices must connect with other vertices.
Furthermore, in this project we need to know the maximal clique in hamming graph.  Maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by including one more adjacent vertex, so it is not a subset of a larger clique.
